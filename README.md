### Mausam - your local weather app

This is a very simple desktop application which provides round the hour updates on Toronto's weather. The data it displays is gathered from World Weather Online's local weather API.  
  
It is intended for use as a wall clock-type weather source. For example, you can hook up an old monitor to a Raspberry Pi and get easy constant access to the weather outside. No need to navigate to a web browser, search for your smartphone, or turn on the local radio to find the temperature outside. Just open the application on an old, unused monitor and turn it into your very own weather station!  
  
To run the application, execute the following command from a terminal  
`./Entry.py &`
